# Valid Models

## Colinearity

* Check for colinearity and correlation, because otherwise the choice of reference level will fail

## Reference level for categorical variables

* Choice of reference levels: Modal factor is level 0
* This independent choice of reference levels per variable only works if variables are in fact independent.
